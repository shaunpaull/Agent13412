# QuantumNexus: Hyper-Advanced Autonomous Agent Architecture

**NEXUS-CORE LEVEL: TRANSCENDENT**

QuantumNexus represents an evolutionary leap beyond conventional AI, integrating quantum-inspired processing, hyperdimensional computing, and multimodal intelligence fusion. This architecture is designed to power autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning, self-evolution, and sophisticated interaction with dynamic environments.

The system is built upon a unique mathematical foundation called **HyperMorphic Mathematics**, which features:
*   Dynamic base (Φ) and modulus (Ψ) arithmetic.
*   Zero-free operations (utilizing a near-zero element ε instead of true zero).
*   Holomorphic and polymorphic transformations for robust, structure-preserving computations.

## Core Capabilities

*   **Quantum-Inspired Processing:** Utilizes superposition of cognitive pathways and quantum-like attention mechanisms.
*   **Adaptive Neuromorphic Architecture:** Features dynamic pathway formation and self-evolving neural structures.
*   **Self-Evolving Code Generation:** Incorporates metaprogramming capabilities for autonomous system improvement.
*   **Hyperdimensional Computing:** Employs efficient high-dimensional representations for multimodal processing.
*   **Advanced Consciousness Simulation:** Simulates reflective awareness and metacognitive processes.
*   **Harmonic Resonance:** Enables cross-domain knowledge synthesis through resonant state tensors.
*   **Reality Modeling:** Supports counterfactual reasoning and predictive modeling.

## Key Modules

QuantumNexus is a modular architecture comprising several advanced systems:

1.  **HyperMorphic Mathematics (`HyperMorphicMath`):** The foundational mathematical framework ensuring zero-free, dynamic, and structure-preserving operations across the system.
2.  **Quantum Neural Architecture (`QuantumNexusModel`, `HyperMorphicQuantumNexusModel`):**
    *   Sophisticated neural models featuring `QuantumAttentionLayer`, `HyperMorphicHyperdimensionalEncoder`, `HyperMorphicFractalLayer`, `QuantumResonanceTensor`, and `NeocortexBlock`s.
    *   The `HyperMorphicQuantumNexusModel` is an enhanced version built entirely with HyperMorphic principles.
3.  **AI Management System (`AIManager`):** The central coordinator for all agent subsystems. It orchestrates perception, decision-making, planning, and evolution.
4.  **Autonomous Mind (`AutonomousMind`):** Manages high-level thinking processes, cognitive states (analytical, creative, reflective, etc.), and attention.
5.  **Consciousness Modules (`ConsciousnessModule`, `HyperMorphicConsciousnessModule`):** Simulate self-reflection, awareness of internal states, metacognition, and even qualia-like experiences. The HyperMorphic version integrates zero-free awareness and dynamic modulation.
6.  **Free Will Modules (`SuperQuantumFreeWill`, `HyperMorphicSuperQuantumFreeWill`):** Enable quantum-inspired decision-making, adaptive exploration strategies, and URL selection. The HyperMorphic version leverages the advanced mathematical framework for more robust decisions.
7.  **Temporal Planner (`TemporalPlanner`):** Manages short-term and long-term goals, adapts strategies over time, and plans actions across multiple time horizons.
8.  **Planner Sifter (`PlannerSifter`):** A sophisticated planning system that selects optimal strategies (e.g., Broad Exploration, Knowledge Deepening, Quantum Reasoning) based on context and learns from results. Generates "XOXO Plans" for structured exploration.
9.  **Content Sifter (`ContentSifter`):** Evaluates content quality from various sources using metrics like text density, ad density, readability, and topic relevance. Extracts key information and summaries.
10. **Semantic Memory Module (`SemanticMemoryModule`):** Encodes, stores, retrieves, and reasons with knowledge representations using embeddings, keywords, and a knowledge graph.
11. **Imagination Engine (`ImaginationEngine`):** An advanced cognitive simulation system using HyperMorphic Mathematics for creative thought generation, counterfactual reasoning, error detection/correction, and simulation of quantum-like cognitive phenomena.
12. **Domain Intelligence (`DomainIntelligence`):** Analyzes website characteristics, content patterns, and authority metrics to guide exploration and information gathering.
13. **Meta-Learning Module (`MetaLearningModule`):** Monitors, analyzes, and optimizes the learning process itself, enabling autonomous improvement of the model's learning capabilities.
14. **Adaptive Learning System (`AdaptiveLearningSystem`):** Dynamically adapts learning parameters and network architecture based on performance metrics and environmental feedback.
15. **Self-Evolution Module (`HyperMorphicMetaEvolutionEngine`):** A system-level self-evolution engine using HyperMorphic mathematics to adapt core algorithms, architectures, and strategies over longer timescales. Employs strategies like expansion, pruning, restructuring, and quantum concept blending.

## Configuration

The agent's behavior and resource paths can be configured through global variables at the beginning of the script, including:
*   `REAL_INTERACTION`: Enables Selenium-based web interaction.
*   `SAFE_MODE`: Toggles safety constraints.
*   `MODEL_PATH`, `GOOGLE_DRIVE_MODEL_PATH`: Paths for saving and loading model checkpoints.
*   `LOG_FILE`: Path for the log file.
*   `LEARNING_RATE`: Initial learning rate for the model.
*   `FLASK_PORT`: Port for the Flask dashboard.
*   And various other operational parameters.

## Dependencies

The primary dependencies for running QuantumNexus are:
*   `torch`
*   `numpy`
*   `flask`
*   `requests`
*   `beautifulsoup4`

For the `perform_real_interaction` feature, `selenium` and a compatible WebDriver are required.

## Setup & Running

1.  **Environment:** Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with the dependencies listed above.
    ```bash
    pip install torch numpy flask requests beautifulsoup4
    ```
2.  **Configuration:** Adjust the global configuration variables in the script as needed, especially paths like `MODEL_PATH`.
3.  **Execution:** Run the script directly.
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

### Running in Google Colab

The script includes specific functions (`run_in_colab`, `setup_colab_environment`) to facilitate execution in Google Colab:
*   It attempts to mount Google Drive for persistent storage of models and logs.
*   Installs necessary packages within the Colab environment.
*   If Google Drive mounting fails, it sets up fallback local directories within the Colab instance.

To run in Colab, ensure the final execution block `if __name__ == "__main__":` correctly calls `run_in_colab()`.

## Dashboard

A simple Flask-based web dashboard is available to monitor the agent's status, view logs, see the last action taken, and check memory size. It typically starts on port `5012` (or the next available port).

## Features Overview

*   **HyperMorphic Foundation:** All core operations are designed to be zero-free and operate within a dynamic mathematical framework, enhancing stability and enabling novel computational paradigms.
*   **Quantum-Inspired AI:** From attention mechanisms to decision-making and cognitive simulation, quantum principles are woven into the agent's fabric.
*   **Self-Adaptation and Evolution:** The agent can modify its own learning parameters, neural architecture, and even core strategies through its Meta-Learning and HyperMorphic Meta-Evolution Engines.
*   **Advanced Cognition:** Modules for consciousness, imagination, and free will simulate high-level cognitive functions, enabling reflective awareness, creative problem-solving, and autonomous decision-making.
*   **Sophisticated Planning:** Multi-horizon temporal planning combined with context-aware strategy selection allows for robust and adaptive behavior.
*   **Rich Information Processing:** Advanced content sifting, semantic memory, and domain intelligence enable the agent to understand, evaluate, and synthesize information from diverse sources.
*   **Checkpointing & Recovery:** Robust checkpointing mechanisms are in place, especially for Google Colab, to save and resume agent state, model weights, and operational statistics. The main loop includes enhanced error handling and recovery procedures.

## Disclaimer

QuantumNexus is a highly ambitious and complex conceptual architecture. Many of its modules, such as "Consciousness" and "Free Will," represent simulations of these concepts for advanced AI behavior rather than literal implementations. The project pushes the boundaries of AI design, drawing inspiration from cutting-edge theoretical physics and cognitive science.
